# Webhook Action Lamatic Index Flow

This GitHub Action detects changes to specified file types in your repository and sends the file content to a webhook. Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios where you need to synchronize or process modified files with an external service.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **File Change Detection**: Monitors specific file types (e.g., `.mdx`, `.json`) and detects newly added or modified files.
- **Webhook Integration**: Sends file content to a specified webhook URL with an authorization key.
- **Configurable**: Easily specify the file type you want to track.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Prerequisites

1. **Webhook URL** and **Webhook Key**: Obtain the webhook URL from lamatic Flow, read [this doc](https://lamatic.ai/docs/interface/webhooks) on how to build a flow with webhooks as a trigger or use this [template](https://hub.lamatic.ai/templates/index-from-github) . 
2. **GitHub Secrets**: Store sensitive data such as `WEBHOOK_URL` and `WEBHOOK_KEY` in your repository secrets.

### Workflow Example
